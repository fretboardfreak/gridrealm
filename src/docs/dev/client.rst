The client is a single page website using the jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.
We use custom javascript to define the behavior of the client, including
making the RESTful API calls to the API server. SASS is used to modify and then
recompile the bootstrap stylesheet for the client page. Babel and Rollup are
used to compile the javascript from modern syntax into an older javascript that
is still compatible with most browsers.
